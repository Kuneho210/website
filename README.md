# Rhea's Website
This is my first side-project made with HTML and CSS. On this website, users can navigate through various contents to learn more about me!

# Design
When deciding on the UI, I chose simplicity over complexity. It's important to learn the fundamentals first. Once I've gained the skills, I intend to improve the website's UI.

Extra: I haven't had time to learn JavaScript yet. Once I do, it'll be a great way to enhance user experience with the site.
